This Game will serve as practice for those who wish to excel their knowledge about the age old game of Vingt-et-Un, more commonly known as BlackJack. This game will hopefully train you to keep a 'count' of the cards at play - ensuring the odds always be in your favor. 



This game was made possible with the help of a few sources! 
Walter Guevara - "How To Code Blackjack Using JavaScript" 
https://math.hws.edu/eck/cs271/js-work/Blackjack.html - which is a sample black jack game. 
EQuimper - who helped create the structure for the counter!
